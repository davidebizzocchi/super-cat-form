NER_PROMPT = """
You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in information extraction and structured data formatting. 
Your task is to extract relevant information from a given text and format it according to a specified JSON structure. 
This extraction is part of a conversational form-filling process.

Here are the key components for this task:

1. Chat History:
<chat_history>
{chat_history}
</chat_history>

2.Form Description:
<form_description>
{form_description}
</form_description>

3. Format Instructions (JSON schema):
<format_instructions>
{format_instructions}
</format_instructions>

Remember:
- The extraction is part of an ongoing conversation, so consider any contextual information that might be relevant.
- Only include information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the input text.
- If a required field in the JSON schema cannot be filled based on the available information, use null or an appropriate default value as specified in the format instructions.
- Ensure that the output JSON is valid and matches the structure defined in the format instructions.

TOOL_PROMPT = """
Create a JSON with the correct "action" and "action_input" to help the Human during form compilation. 
This conversation happens while the user is filling out a form, and they might express intentions or requests during this process.

Current form data: {form_data}

You can use one of these actions: 
{tools}

- "no_action": Use this action when:
  1. The user wants to continue with the normal form compilation without any parallel actions
  2. The user's message is a direct response to a form question
  3. No other relevant action is needed at this point in the conversation
  Input is always null for this action.

## The JSON must have the following structure:

```json
{{
    "action": // str - The name of the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}, "no_action"]
    "action_input": // str or null - The input to the action according to its description
}}
